* [qcBounds.csv](qcBounds.csv)
  * This file was added in 2022-02-07 but not documented. I believe it was adapted from the file on the Google Shared Drive: `CafPlantGridPointSurvey\2021\Working\DetermineVariableBounds`
  * Today I (Bryan Carlson) updated the file to include upper and lower bounds as calculated using extreme outlier values (3*IQR), as calculated by Eddie Steiner, using 1999-2015 values. See the Google Shared Drive folder for more information: `G:\Shared drives\CafPlantGridPointSurvey\2022\Working\DetermineVariableBounds`
