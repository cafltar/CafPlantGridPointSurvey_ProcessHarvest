  - "Ok, took us a few extra moments (months…) to clean up some hiccups in this set, but attached should now be the verified results for ALL 2021 residues! No reweighs needed from my end, I believe this set is now complete." - Jenny

  - > It’s here! HY2021 Canola grain elemental data, in its entirety.
    > Any errors have already been rerun, so this can be considered the final data set unless people want additional reps for any reason.
    > 
    > For sample ID’s please note that we were given all items ending in code “Sub01,” so we discussed and decided to add the suffix “_CG” for the coffee grinding done within my lab – this was a unique procedure done only to this set so far. At the very bottom of the report, there are also 64 reps of a subset of the coffee ground materials, these end in “_CGOD” indicating that a small scoop was additionally dried in the oven post-grinding, but before weighing and analysis. These reps should allow a look at whether the final oven drying step altered the C or N content measurement, thus indicating that either the “CG” samples were falsely high due to retained water, or that the oven drying might burn off some content – my guess would be C if that did occur. Or, give us confidence that the final oven drying made no change and was unnecessary.

    > Finally, at the very bottom of report are 3 Art samples found in the totes, but not submitted in the original sample list. And scattered throughout the whole report, several samples that were in the list from PCFS, but no physical samples found in the totes, denoted by “No sample submitted.”
