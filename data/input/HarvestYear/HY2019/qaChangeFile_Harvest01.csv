CE304_GP_2019_WW_Bio,Update,SeedMassAirDry,1213,"Grain biomass is questionable given the higher total biomass.  Likely the weight should be 1244.  The macro-scripted for the 2019 contained an error that sometimes dropped a repeated number if the number was at the end.  Also, test weight was done using the large kettle and 93 grams would not have been enough grain to use the large kettle for the test weight measurment.  ",Ian Leslie
