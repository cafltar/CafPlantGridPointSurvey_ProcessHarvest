  - > "Happy Monday, attached is the complete EA/IRMS data set for Harvest Year 2020 residues! A massive thanks to Zach for this batch, as he has been involved at all levels from starting many of the runs, to fighting new software, to necessarily innovating a whole new layout for our Data sheets and Data tab in the report. All are completely “certified” on our end, no reweighs or flags. The only major note is a reminder that after the earliest runs, we stopped gathering isotopic data due to mass spec breakdown, and decision to push forward with just the elemental data. So (mostly for Bryan’s understanding) this entire set is labelled as “MS_date….etc” because some of the data has mass spec results, but most of the data lines only have the elemental results. Going forward, that data will be labelled “EA_date…” by my system of data report filing." - Jenny
